Profile
========

Supports configurable user profiles.

This module is the successor to the [Drupal 7 Profile2 module](https://drupal.org/project/profile2).

Installation
-------------

* Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

Usage
-----

* Visit the configuration page under Administration > Structure >
  Profiles (admin/structure/profiles) for managing profile types.

* By default users may view their profile at /user and edit them at
   user/N/edit.

Upgrading from Drupal 7
-----------------------

This module is the successor to the [Drupal 7 Profile2
module](https://drupal.org/project/profile2) and can automatically import and
convert any Profile2 profiles when upgrading from a Drupal 7 installation.

Note that this module does _not_ import from the [deprecated Profile
module](https://www.drupal.org/node/874026) that was provided in Drupal 7 core
as an upgrade path from Drupal 6 sites that used Profiles. If you have profiles
from the Drupal 7 Profile module, you should either convert them to Profile2
profiles in Drupal 7 prior to upgrading to Backdrop, or recreate them in
Backdrop after you upgrade.

If you are migrating Drupal 7 Profile2 profiles to Backdrop Profile, you should,
however, _enable_ the Drupal 7 Profile module before preparing the db for
migration.
